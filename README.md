# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This challenge was to create a calender type application that allows the user to save tasks for each hour in a work day.
Another feature, is that the current time, as long as the past and future times are indicated by 3 different colors, visually this makes it easier to keep up with your day.

We were supplied with some starter code, and using Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, Moment,js and more, I was able to succesfully get all of the functionality up and running.
